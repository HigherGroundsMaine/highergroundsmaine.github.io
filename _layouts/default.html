We both got the French Toast Latte with Oatmilk, which was delicious. I got mine half as sweet, which made it more palatable for me. My spouse got his the regular style, but added CBD to aid in calming and reducing his anxiety. He said it was awesome and he loved the idea of combining the two products. The owner was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and it was a great atmosphere as well."</p>

                  <p>"The best. Where to begin? My favorite combination of treats is excellent coffee and kind bud. Higher Grounds achieves both by offering a first-rate coffee bar with a cannabis apothecary experience. The staff is super-chill and friendly, with an impressive level of knowledge about all of their products. I've been smoking weed for almost 45 years and learned a few new things as I was also talked about rock'n'roll, the wonders of Maine, how I like to enjoy cannabis, what I was looking for, and the lore and science of the strains that might interest me. I really fell in love with this place, and will be back with friends."</p>

The staff is very accommodating to either of those needs. They are huge advocates for premium medicine at affordable pricing and do business with extremely experienced growers to provide the best product possible in the area. In a perfect world, most places would strive to be like them and become a staple of what modern medicine should be. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your communities that are inspiring to say the least."</p>

Several flower strains won't be found anywhere else, including my most powerful personal medicine (if you see anything by Beyond Organics on the menu, snag it!). Several tiers of pricing to offer affordable options to everyone, and regular deals to bring just about anything within reach. If your research through the entangled web of Maine cannabis brings you across HG, highly recommend giving it a shot!"</p>
